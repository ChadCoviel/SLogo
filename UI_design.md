#UI Design

The user will interact with our program through several key components including the menu bar, the command input piece, and the buttons. The menu bar houses the parts dealing with the overall functionality of the project including choosing the background color, creating a new workspace, and saving user-defined functions. 

The buttons include moving the turtle, choosing a pen color, turning the pen on and off, and saving the current preferences. The command input piece contains a text input component where the user enters what commands they want the turtle to do, and when they are done with this, they can press the “Execute” button to see their commands in action. The user also has a list of the current user-defined variables and functions available for them to view as well. These are not yet clickable, but because of the object that they are housed in, the ScrollableTextArea, that functionality will be able to be added rather easily. 

There is also the panel that displays the turtle to the user, so they can see their commands in action. The user is able to choose what image to put here when the program is started and whenever a new workspace is created through a dialog. There are various other dialog windows that are popped by this project. These include when the user attempts to load or save their currently defined functions and when the user tries to load or save their preferences.
